Closure: give ability to access an outer function's scope from inner functions
- for using closure: just simply define a function inside another function and expose to it 
- to expose a function: return it or pass it to another function

person = function() {
    var increment = 1;
    this.next = function() {
        increment ++;
        alert(increment)
    }
}

var p = new person();
p.next() => 2
p.next() => 3
p.next() => 4
