Functional Programming (FP): 
 - is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, side effects.
 - is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions

Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
 - application state is usually shared and colorated with methods in objects
